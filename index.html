                <p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXfbQAimgtbk4RAUHtIAUww" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">The Lizzie Bennet Diaries</em></a> (<a href="http://www.pemberleydigital.com/the-lizzie-bennet-diaries/" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">lizziebennet.com</a>) a modern retelling of Pride and Prejudice in vlog form, is the Internet's answer to Hollywood's <i>Bridget Jones's Diary series</i>. Forget Oscar nominations and red carpets -- the Internet has beloved fictional characters that you can tweet at, send an email to and get advice from. And it appears to be working.</p>

                <p>More than a year after the series ended, Lizzie Bennet, which premiered in April 2012, has more than 250,000 YouTube subscribers and millions of hits. It's also spawned several spin-off Web series, its own production company and a sub-genre of YouTube filmmaking. And now the people behind that Web series phenomenon are bringing another classic to digital life, with <a href="http://www.pemberleydigital.com/frankenstein-md/" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">Frankenstein, M.D</a></p>

                <p>"When I was growing up, you never got to interact with your favorite characters," said Bernie Su, showrunner of Lizzie Bennet and co-founder of the Web production company<a href="http://www.pemberleydigital.com/" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">Pemberley Digital</a>. "This is why I think the format works and there's a demand for them and a shelf life for them."</p>

                <p>Pemberley had until now stuck with Jane Austen adaptations, but its new project, <i>Frankenstein, M.D.</i>, debuts Aug. 19 and gives Pemberley's modern vlogging style a supernatural twist. The 24-episode series continues the studio's practice of featuring female heroines, changing the titular Victor Frankenstein into medical student Victoria Frankenstein. It's also the company's first foray into partnering with a network TV channel's digital arm, PBS Digital Studios (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pbsdigitalstudios" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios</a>). Episodes will be released Tuesdays and Fridays, ending with a Halloween finale Oct. 31. "I like to think we're creating franchises rather than just Web series," Bernie Su said. </p>

                        <p>"A lot of branching out has been outside of Web content, with books and interactivity. This is the greatness of what we do — is we grow the roles out bigger than just video."</p>

                <p>Other YouTube filmmakers both amateur and professional have taken a cue from Pemberley and <i>Lizzie Bennet</i>, using the tools of the Internet to bring their favorite literary characters straight to the audience. Adaptations of everything from <i>Jane Eyre, Peter Pan, Romeo and Juliet and Anne of Green Gables</i> have hit the Web, letting the characters reach out to viewers through YouTube, Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram.</p>

                <p>"I am very happy that our show inspired other people to be creative," said Ashley Clements, who played the titular character in <i>The Lizzie Bennet Diaries</i>. "The model that <i>Lizzie Bennet</i> set up is very doable. It relies heavily on the writing and actors, but not on extensive equipment."</p>

                <p>Unlike the Pemberley productions — which have the benefit of support from Web entrepreneur Hank Green, these series tend to be low budget, relying on crowdfunding or the personal pockets of the filmmakers. Some of the filmmakers aren't even out of high school yet.</p>

               <p>"For so many people, (these Web series) became their passion project," said Kyle Waters, the co-creator and star of <i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EpicRobotTV" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none"> The New Adventures of Peter and Wendy</a></i>. "When you're working on a passion project, you don't necessarily worry about payday. But it's sort of exciting because… you have to focus on creativity and ingenuity and elbow grease."</p>

                <p>The filmmakers found that audiences connected with their characters in more ways than they expected, sending them advice through email or Twitter, even though they knew they were fictional. When a series would finally come to a close, crew members found themselves fielding requests for just one more video.</p>
                <p>"One of best and worst things in (our) project was how much people needed Jane," said Alysson Hall, the star of <i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAOJaneEyre" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none"> The Autobiography of Jane Eyre</a></i>."People always ask me if she's going to come back. But every story has an end."</p>

                        <dd>The one that started them all. The modern adaptation of Pride and Prejudice presented Lizzie Bennet as a funny, charismatic and stubborn graduate student talking about her family and her love life through vlogs and costume theater re-enactments. The series, which lasted 100 episodes, cleverly replaced some of the Regency-era romantic subplots with more relatable dilemmas about career and cyber life. (lizziebennet.com)</dd></li>

                        <dd>Perhaps the most dramatic of the literary Web series thus far, <i>The Autobiography of Jane Eyre</i> tackled issues like abuse, mental illness and unhealthy relationships. While tonally imperfect, the star of the show, Alysson Hall, infused Jane with a deadpan wit and sympathetic gawkiness that made it easy to swallow even the most outlandish of the original book's plot twists.

                    <li><dt><strong><a href="http://thenewpeterandwendy.com/" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">The New Adventures of Peter and Wendy</a></strong></dt>

                        <dd>This Web series transformed Peter Pan from the boy who wouldn't grow up into a 20-something man child who wouldn't grow up. So basically, every other millennial. Set in the small town of Neverland, Ohio, this quirky series follows the adventures of advice vlogger Wendy Darling, her two immature brothers, her bossy friend Lily and her best friend Peter Pan. The series just finished its first season with a bittersweet ending and is raising funds on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-new-adventures-of-peter-and-wendy-season-2" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">Indiegogo</a>for a second season.

                    <li><dt><strong><a href="http://greengablesfables.webs.com/""remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">Green Gables Fables</a></strong></dt>

                        <dd>This adaptation of <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> is perhaps the most low-budget series, with half of its crew still in high school. But it's a charming adaptation of the first book, presenting Anne as a motor-mouthed high schooler and foster kid with excellent fashion sense. There have only been 20 episodes and Gilbert Blythe hasn't even made an appearance yet, but the writing is on par and Anne is hilariously lovable. (greengablesfables.webs.com)</dd></li>

                    <li><dt><strong><a href="http://www.emmaapproved.com/" "remove-hyperlink-underline.php" style="text-decoration: none">Emma Approved</a></strong></dt> 

                        <dd>The production value is quality and the acting is great, but this adaptation of <i>Emma</i> seems a bit less sincere than its sister show <i>The Lizzie Bennet Diaries</i>. Maybe because it turns Emma, already a semi-unlikable character, into an unapologetic businesswoman with a limitless wardrobe. The show has excelled at the emotional showdowns, however, and the chemistry between Emma and Alex Knightley is all kinds of cute. (emmaapproved.com)</dd></li>
